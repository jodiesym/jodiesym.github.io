    <br><h2>Latitude vs. Humidity</h2><br>
    <p class="mb-0">As you can see, there is also no clear relationship between latitude and cloudiness. 
        Data is very evenly spread. Humidity could have some correlation with cloudiness, but it could be more related with locations, 
        because coastal cities have higher humidity than desert cities.
