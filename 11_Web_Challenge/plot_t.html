    <br><h2>Latitude vs. Temperature</h2><br>
    <p class="mb-0"> As you can see there is a very clear pattern between the latitude and the temperature. 
        When the latitude gets closer to the equator, the temperature will be more likely to increase. 
        However the temperature didn't drop / increase the same ratio as the change in latitude. 
        We can see that the southern hemisphere tends to be warmer, which makes sense because the data was taken in Janurary, 
        which is the southern hemisphere's summer, and its still winter in the northern hemisphere.
