    <br><h2>Latitude vs. Wind Speed</h2><br>
    <p class="mb-0"> There might be a weak relationship between wind speed and latitude. 
        There seems to be a tendency that when the latitude is farther from the equator, the higher wind speed will be. 
        However since the R-Square is not significantly high, we may need a larger dataset to prove the hypothesis, 
        or we will reject the hypothesis that such correlation does not exist.
